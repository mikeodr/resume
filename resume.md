## Experience

### [**Arctic Wolf**](https://arcticwolf.com) - _Jan 2019 - Present_

> Senior Software Engineer

- Maintain, update and improve a footprint of 50,000+ sensors globally, with services distributed across 6 AWS regions.
- Built login flow using Auth0 for customer self service activation of sensors, improving customer experience and reducing customer onboarding time from days to hours.
- Authored runbooks on IP routing, Layer7 filtering, and DNS configuration troubleshooting of VPN connectivity issues in customer networks, eliminating 90% of all tickets passed to the engineering team for triage.
- Improved customer security outcomes by optimizing Suricata configurations, improving packet performance, and decreasing dropped packets up to 90%.
- Led updates to observability and alerting on all sensors, coordinating with observability and security services teams to deliver actionable alerts directly to customers, reducing sensor downtime and misconfigurations.
- Updated build pipeline to generate a single unified image that all virtual and physical platforms share, decreasing build chain complexity and testing time.
- Lead the team in adding support for new hypervisors. Opening up $2mm in potential bookings with the release of the Azure virtual sensor.
- Simplified Sensor configuration by moving manual toil to Golang backend services with OpenAPI REST based APIs, reducing provisioning and operation teams overhead and eliminating manual steps.
- Coordinated with infrastructure teams to migrate backend services to AWS Graviton, realizing 10-30% savings in OpEx.
