## Summary

My experience ranges from low level drivers to user facing GUIs.
I've helped ship millions of phones, hundreds of robots, and secured numerous customer's networks.
Much of my hobby work is open source and you can find it on my Github.
My home infrastructure is deployed as much as possible with infrastructure as code.
I've automated my home with Home Assistant, and I monitor my infrastructure via Prometheus with outage alerts through PagerDuty. Ask me more, I'd be happy to share!
