## Summary

I am a software developer with 14 years experience. My technical skills range from low level drivers to user facing GUIs.
I've helped ship millions of phones, hundreds of robots, and secured numerous customer's networks. My home infrastructure is deployed with infrastructure as code, and I monitor it via Prometheus and receive outage alerts with PagerDuty. I've also automated my home with Home Assistant. Ask me more, I'd be happy to share!

## Experience

### **Arctic Wolf** - _Jan 2019 - Present_ Remote/Waterloo, ON

> Senior Software Engineer

> Golang, Python, Flask, OpenAPI, Ansible, Kubernetes, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, Terraform, AWS, Azure, Prometheus

- Improve customer security outcomes by optimizing Suricata configurations, improving performance, and decreasing dropped packets up to 90% in specific circumstances.
- Led updates to observability and alerting on all sensors. Coordinating with observability and security services teams to deliver actionable alerts directly to customers, reducing sensor downtime and misconfigurations.
- Updated build pipeline to generate a single unified image that all virtual and physical platforms share, decreasing build chain complexity and testing.
- Brought up multiple new physical hardware configurations, increasing sales by providing various performance options and form factors.
- Added support for multiple hypervisors for virtual sensors, reducing sales friction by providing more options to a wider variety of customers. Opening up an estimated $2mm in potential bookings with the general availability of the Azure virtual sensor.
- Simplified Sensor configuration by moving manual toil to REST based APIs, reducing provisioning and operation teams overhead and increasing efficiency.
- Coordinated with infrastructure teams to migrate multiple backend services to AWS Graviton, realizing 10-30% savings in OpEx.
- Authored detailed runbooks for operations teams to troubleshoot customer network and connectivity issues, eliminating 90% of all tickets passed to the engineering team for triage

### **Dejero** - _Feb 2018 - Dec 2018_ Waterloo, ON

> Software Developer
